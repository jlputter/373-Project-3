# 373-Project-3
Small app using observer pattern to determine discount prices. 

The point of this project was to see how to implement the observer pattern and show its use. The app is uses an 
observer to load and unload the client with different concrete classes which extend the observer. In this app
I made a simple discount calculator which updates the state based on the discount amount.
